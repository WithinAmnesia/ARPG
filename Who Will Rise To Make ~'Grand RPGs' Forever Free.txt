Who Will Rise To Make ~'Grand RPGs' Forever Free?

Flare cannot do multiplayer this I feel has troubled many people including myself.
Godot has a big staff and is free and open source with a very friendly MIT license that is proven to work for commercial projects as well across nearly all platforms PC, Mobile and Consoles.
Godot 4+ has successfully implemented seriously impressive multiplayer functionality: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html

I am also troubled by the Solaris Engine: https://www.solarus-games.org/features/ . It has a limited future yet has an incredible linage and a beautiful vision for the future. Yet it has very limited prospects going forward and is free and open source as well. Perhaps we can save them too for a Diablo / Zelda hybrid like a ~'Ziablo'?

I am troubled by the gaming industry it feels more and more that it is up to the community now to make high quality RPGs and 2D games are the foundations of most all majorly successful video game series. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises most of the top 50 best selling video game franchise started in the 2D era from the 1970's to 2000's and a lot from the 80's and 90's specifically. As I have pushed the Unreal Engine 5+ to its 8K+ limits and beyond and with great help we did 4K with the Flare engine. Yet it seems I still cannot be immune to the raw creative efficiency of the development of 2D video games. Its very hard to beat a 2D game for a start as a single person or a small team which is the vast majority of people who wish to start making video games.

I was banned from Classic World of Warcraft Wrath of Lich King for talking in world chat. I practically grew up in WoW and was raised by the online community. I never had much of family but I always had video games; and in my decades of adventure I have been banned for talking in world chat. I was not banned by a human, but a robot. This video sums it up very clearly and is very funny still. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2syg93jfvk&ab_channel=CaptainGrim

I have done my best to rally the Private server community for WoW to bring back new thrilling 40 person raiding. I am one of the world's most hardcore vanilla WoW raiders; I've beaten WoW https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFors1WXgTM . Yet it is not enough, WoW is old and dying. World of Warcraft came from the Warcraft RTS series which came from the days of 16 bit gaming on the SNES and Blizzard started work on their first game a modified 8 bit game from the NES. Warcraft started as a RTS modified version of The Lost Vikings: https://old.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bokx62/warcraft_started_as_the_lost_vikings_rts/ . With Diablo 4 in the dumps https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/diablo-iv/user-reviews and Final Fantasy XIV not being a worthy successor it seems that the burden is now on the community to create worthy Grand RPGs.

I tried my best for Flare, we pushed it to 4K flareteam/flare-game#940 but it does not support multiplayer and to make those 4K graphics was a nightmare to be honest for it was incredibly complex to add more and more and more. I explored Unreal engine and rallied the best RPG creatives in the world together for one cause to make the foundation of a grand RPG that is multiplayer and in 8K+ with the most advanced controls and graphics in the world. Yet it is a hard slow slog grinding on for years but there are thrilling successes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18zEhXInJag&ab_channel=CTGame + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=994FgtShOi4&ab_channel=EasySystems + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rjspwrw5oo&ab_channel=CTGame Yet this is only for the most hardened more intense and ferocious of game developers in the world. Literally thousands have tried yet less than 10 have succeeded in the unreal community to bring about these epic successes for the world's RPG developer community.

Thus I turned to where it all began and as I search and downloaded every free CC0 asset on itch.io and opengameart.org to better learn and feel what is 2D game art and to save as much as I could I came to learn that 2D games are what most people need to start. They are easiest to start and tinker with and they offer a sound solid foundation for more advanced adventures later on. Itch.io is the home of new independent game developers just trying to begin and its like first friendly stop off from the digital wasteland wildness. As of which I and many have grew up within, honing our skills and being ever creatively sharper as the years and decades march onwards.

We are at a crossroads in time it feels, the end of the monolithic corporate past and the beginning of new forever free future. I am trying to find ways for regular everyday people to have a chance to make the game of their dreams. Yet it is still too hard to start and many people give up before they even truly began. All this haunts myself greatly, wandering this endless graveyard of dreams.

All the RPGs seem to play the same, they all come from the same sources, inspirations, videos games, mythology and shared visions and dreams: Fairy-tales pre-1800's-1900's, Tolkien 1930's-1950's, D&D 1970-1980's, PC and Arcade and Consoles 1970's-1980's, Zelda 1986, Diablo 1997, WoW 2004. Yet the creative community lacks a forever free ~'Grand RPG' engine that welcomes and empowers all of the creative dreamers of the world.

How many dreams have died already because people simply did not have a chance to even start making a game? Not everyone can code and is an artist and talented in multiple disciplines, not many people have any friends who can help. For literally decades I have searched far and wide across the world online; only to just to find a handful of creative ferociously talented people and who have a common heart who care about the future of this gaming community. Even this I am not sure it is enough; yet I still hope.

I look at these masterful assets, made from an anonymous source ~'Baldur Something' that commissioned one of the world's greatest 2D video game asset artists for the whole world to be better with as CC0 ~public domain assets. Yet still these master pieces have no engine, it has no heartbeat. https://itch.io/c/1557879/lucifer + https://foozlecc.itch.io/lucifer-exterior-tileset + https://foozlecc.itch.io/lucifer-warrior

I ask who can give these assets a worthy heartbeat? The Lucifer 2D video game art asset series is meant to be integrated with a CC0 / MIT / ~'Public Domain' Diablo / Zelda / ~'Grand RPG' engine for the whole world to benefit from; and right now more than ever the world needs a chance. Who can give the world a chance? I found this person from Ukraine who works with Godot making Diablo and Zelda and ~'Grand RPG' like elements https://github.com/don-tnowe and I wonder who else can help the world and save all these dreams of great RPGs? How long do we really have left to do something that makes the world a better place? Who will rise to make ~'Grand RPGs' forever free?
