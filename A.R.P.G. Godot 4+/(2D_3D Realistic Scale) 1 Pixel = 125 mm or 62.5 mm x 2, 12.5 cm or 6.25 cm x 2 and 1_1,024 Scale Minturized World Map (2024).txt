(2D/3D Realistic Scale) 1 Pixel = 125 mm or 62.5 mm x 2, 12.5 cm or 6.25 cm x 2 and 1/1,024 Scale Minturized World Map (2024)

1/1,024 Scale (or written as 1:1,024 scale) is like when you divide something in half 10 times in a row like:
1.) 1/2
2.) 1/4
3.) 1/8
4.) 1/16
5.) 1/32
6.) 1/64
7.) 1/128
8.) 1/256
9.) 1/512
10.) 1/1,024

1km x 1km area 'map' = 1,000 meters x 1,000 meters or like 1,000 x 1,000 tiles with 16 x 16 pixel tiles so to find what 1 pixel = in mm to scale things somewhat accurately to keep things together for making a proper miniaturized world scaled to 1/1,024 scale from a pixel all the way to the planet accurately we go like: 1,000 meters x 1,000 meter = 1,000 x 1,000 map area block / tiles and each block / tile is 1/1000 of a kilometer or like 1 block / tile is 1 meter by 1 meter and each face has 16 x 16 pixels. So 1 meter = 1,000 milimeters / mm. So 1,000 mm / 16 pixels = 62.5 mm per pixel.
[10:31]
Or like 32 pixels = 32 x 62.5 mm = 2,000 mm = 2,000 mm / 25.4 mm = 1 inch = ~78.740 inch / 12 = ~6.561 feet.

So this warrior who with the armour worn is ~32 pixels tall is in total ~6.5-6 ish game scale at 1/1,024 miniturized scale. Perhaps ~5.6-6.2 feet tall without armour in height. Each pixel is like ~ 2.5 inches or like 2 pixels ~5 inches or like 3 pixels is like ~7 inches ~4 pixels is like ~10 inches, ~5 pixels = ~12 inches / 1 foot, 6 pixels = 14-15 inches / ~1-1/4-5 feet. So if 32 pixels with armour - like 2-6 pixels without armour gets like yeah 5.7 feet to ~6.2 feet tall which is reasonable.

Everything fits together really accurately now."

2D Realistic Sprites for ~3 meter / ~6ft tall humanoids are ~32x64 pixels in x and y dimensions for minimum detail to achieve 2D/3D realistic scale immersion.
