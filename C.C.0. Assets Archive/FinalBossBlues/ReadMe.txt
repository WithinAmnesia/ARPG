FAQ:

Q: Are these tiles compatible with my other asset packs (Time Fantasy/Elements)?

Sure. They use the same 16x16 tilebase.

Style-wise, they fall somewhere in between Time Fantasy and the upcoming Elements tiles (in fact, I'll probably re-use some object tiles here and there to fill out 
the set, so like a random TF chair tile or something might find its way into the public domain lol). 

The OpenRTP tiles should look good when mixed with either style-- and hopefully other styles by other people!!-- though note that the colors would need to be tweaked 
to match Time Fantasy.

Q: Will these OpenRTP tiles be released in RMMV/MZ formats?

No. Because they're released as completely free, you are welcome to edit and re-organize them to whatever works for you.

These tiles are arranged in the "chipset" format used by RM2K/3 and EasyRPG. They're designed specifically to correspond with and overwrite the original RM2K/3 
RTP tilesets.

Q: Does a big open-source release compete against your own asset business?

Uh... I hope not! 😨 

I think that I'm in a unique position to create a set like this, and release it for free, specifically because I have the backing and support of my patrons.

About:

These tilesets were created as my contribution to the EasyRPG OpenRTP project.

These sets contain entirely original artwork that is arranged in the same way as the classic RPGMaker2K/3 RTP chipsets. They correspond with the original sets and 
can replace them as a free alternative to the RTP.

Games preservation is an important topic these days, and especially for me, where RM2K/3 games were hugely influential on me and the online culture I came up in. 
EasyRPG makes playing those games possible on modern systems, so it's an important tool for preservation. It goes in the other direction too, enabling modern releases 
so that people can use the RM2K/3 engines to make games in 2022 and beyond.

On a personal note, I'm really proud of this little project. I spent all my middle school and teenage years playing with RM2K/3, and there's something really fulfilling 
about recreating the entire RTP tiles. Sure, I've made *more* than this already with Time Fantasy... but this seems like I've accomplished something that I wanted to do 
my whole life.

I'm happy to release these sets as a way to give back to the hobby that has given me so much.
