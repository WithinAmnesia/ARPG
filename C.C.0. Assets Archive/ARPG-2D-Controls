I got the ARPG combat and Wyvern systems inventory systems working. The next major task is getting the attributes and abilities to work together. This is a really good start so far. WASD to move, space bar to attack and shift to dash and I and Tab for inventory and I think escape for close some menus and there is a type working inventory search function.
